# Job Recommendation System Report

## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

### 1.1 Gather Dataset
For this project, we obtained a dataset containing job listings from Kaggle. The dataset was sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/code/thedocs/it-job-recommendation/input] and comprises information about job Title, Company, Job description, Job requirements, etc.

### 1.2 Preprocessing
To ensure the quality of the data, we performed the following preprocessing steps:
- Handled missing values: Checked for and addressed any missing values in the dataset.
- Extracted relevant features: Focused on extracting key features such as company, job requirements, eligibility, title, job description, etc.

## 2. Feature Engineering

### 2.1 Define Features
The chosen features for the recommendation system include company, job requirements, eligibility, title, job descriptions. These features were selected based on their relevance to job matching.

### 2.2 Data Transformation
To prepare the data for machine learning models, we implemented the following techniques:
- One-hot encoding: Converted categorical variables into numerical format.
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Used to transform text data into numerical vectors, giving more weight to important terms.

## 3. Model Selection and Training

### 3.1 Explore Algorithms
We considered various algorithms for building the recommendation system, such as KNN, content-based filtering, Naive Bayes F1 Score, Logistic Regression and neural networks. The choice of algorithms was based on their suitability for the given dataset and problem.

### 3.2 Data Splitting
To evaluate the performance of the models, we divided the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set was used to train the models and the testing set was employed to assess their predictive capabilities.

### 3.3 Model Training
We trained the selected models using the training set. The models underwent iterative training to optimize their parameters and enhance their ability to make accurate recommendations.

## 4. Recommendation Engine Development

### 4.1 Develop Engine
We implemented a recommendation engine that takes user profiles as input and produces job recommendations as output. The engine utilizes the trained models to generate personalized suggestions based on user preferences and job characteristics.

### 4.2 Ranking System
To enhance the relevance of job recommendations, we incorporated a ranking mechanism. This mechanism ensures that the recommended jobs are ranked by their similarity to the user profile, providing a more tailored and effective suggestion.

## 5. Evaluation

### 5.1 Performance Metrics
We assessed the performance of the recommendation system using precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and effectiveness of the system in suggesting relevant job opportunities.

### 5.2 Testing
The system underwent thorough testing using the designated testing dataset. The analysis of results from the testing phase helps in understanding how well the recommendation engine generalizes to unseen data.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this job recommendation system integrates data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation to provide personalized and relevant job suggestions for users. The implementation of a ranking system enhances the quality of recommendations, ensuring that users receive the most suitable job opportunities based on their profiles. Ongoing optimization and fine-tuning can further improve the system's performance and user satisfaction.
